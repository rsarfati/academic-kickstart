*Editor's note: The release of the March 2020 DSGE forecast was postponed as New York Fed economists shifted their focus to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the [June 2020 forecast](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/06/the-new-york-fed-dsge-model-forecastjune-2020.html) now out, we've decided to post this forecast for the record as well.*

This post presents an update of the economic forecasts generated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. We describe very briefly our forecast and its change since [December 2019](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/09/the-new-york-fed-dsge-model-forecastsdecember-2019.html). As usual, we wish to remind our readers that the DSGE model forecast is not an official New York Fed forecast, but only an input to the Research staff's overall forecasting process. For more information about the model and variables discussed here, see our [DSGE model Q & A](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/blog/2018/LSE_dsge-forecast-appendix).
