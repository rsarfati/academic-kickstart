This post presents an update of the economic forecasts generated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorkœôòùs dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. We describe very briefly our forecast and its change since [July 2018](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2018/07/the-new-york-fed-dsge-model-forecastjuly-2018.html). As usual, we wish to remind our readers that the DSGE model forecast is not an official New York Fed forecast, but only an input to the Research staffœôòùs overall forecasting process. For more information about the model and variables discussed here, see our [DSGE model Q & A](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/blog/2018/LSE_dsge-forecast-appendix).
